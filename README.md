# Bank Management Application

## Project Description
The **Bank Management** application will let users create *bank accounts* and efficiently manage them. Possible features include checking *balance* and making *deposits*; making *transactions* or *transfers*; listing all bank accounts and the *history* of transactions or transfers. International college students or businessmen can use this application to have multiple accounts and effortlessly manage them for different and fast transactions. 

This project is of interest to me because I had trouble trying to open a bank account and transfer money from an international one to pay for my tuition, and I wished there was a more straightforward system to work with.
