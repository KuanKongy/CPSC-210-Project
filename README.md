# Bank Management Application

## Project Description
The **Bank Management** application will let users create *bank accounts* and efficiently manage them. Possible features include checking *balance* and making *deposits*; making *transactions* or *transfers*; listing all *bank accounts* and the *history* of *transactions* or *transfers*. International college students or businessmen can use this application to have multiple accounts and effortlessly manage them for different and fast transactions. 

This project is of interest to me because I had trouble trying to open a bank account and transfer money from an international one to pay for my tuition, and I wished there was a more straightforward system to work with.
